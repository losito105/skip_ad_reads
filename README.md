Do you constantly find yourself fast-forwarding through ad-reads while watching videos on YouTube?
Run this program in the background of the video you are watching, and when an ad-read is detected, it will be skipped!
Don't waste your time watching ads! Skip them without lifting a finger! ... Except to initially run the program of course :)
